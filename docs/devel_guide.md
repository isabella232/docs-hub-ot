The OT uses a :abbr:`REST (Representational State Transfer)` API. A JSON message is returned by all API responses including errors
and HTTP response status codes are to designate success and failure.

Authentication and authorization
--------------------------------

Requests to the Read the Docs public API are for public and private information.
All endpoints require authentication.


APiKey
~~~~~

The ``Authorization`` HTTP header can be specified with ``ApiKey <your-key>``
to authenticate as a user and have the same permissions that the user itself.

.. note::

   You will find your access Token under
   `your profile settings <https://readthedocs.org/accounts/tokens/>`_.
